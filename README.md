## Course Description

<p>Ruby, the popular object-oriented open-source programming language, is a great place to start learning programming or web development. You can use it to write interactive programs or to build scripts to speed up workflows and common tasks. In this course, instructor Kevin Skoglund covers everything new and experienced developers need to know to code with Ruby, from core object types and control structures to object-oriented programming with classes and modules. Along the way, Kevin outlines best practices and practical examples through a series of fun coding challenges. By the end of this course, you’ll be prepared to start coding in Ruby to define your own custom methods with loops and conditional logic.</p><p>This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time-all while using a tool that you'll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out the "Using GitHub Codespaces with this course" video to learn how to get started.</p>

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.

To resolve this issue:
